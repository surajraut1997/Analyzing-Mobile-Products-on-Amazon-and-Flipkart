In my project titled 'Amazon and Flipkart Market Analysis under the Mobile Category,' I utilized Python, Pandas, and Power BI to gather insights from data sourced from the Amazon and Flipkart websites. 
To collect the data, I employed Python's Beautiful Soup library for web scraping. This allowed me to extract relevant information such as Mobile Price, Brands, Models, and Customer Ratings.
Next, I leveraged the Pandas library to organize the collected data into a structured format by creating a data frame. 
This enabled efficient manipulation, analysis, and visualization of the data. I then generated a CSV file to store the processed data for further analysis.
To present the findings effectively, I utilized Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool. Using its features, I designed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. 
The dashboard showcased key insights, trends, and comparisons between Amazon and Flipkart in terms of mobile prices, popular brands, models, and customer ratings.
Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in web scraping, data manipulation using Pandas, and data visualization using Power BI. 
Furthermore, I showcased the ability to analyze market trends, draw meaningful conclusions, and communicate findings through impactful visual representations.
This project not only enhanced my technical skills in Python, Pandas, and Power BI but also provided practical experience in data collection, analysis, and visualization within the context of the e-commerce industry."
